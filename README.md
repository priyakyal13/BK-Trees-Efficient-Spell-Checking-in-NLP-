# BK-Trees-Efficient-Spell-Checking-in-NLP-
In this project,we have implemented spell check and prediction of incorrect words with the help of BK(Burkhard Keller)trees.BK Tree is a data structure that is used to perform spell check based on the Edit Distance (Levenshtein distance) concept. BK trees are also used for approximate string matching.
